This repo serves as my exploration into the abilities of Google's ARCore and how it works.
For all of the projects I am making use of ARCore's Android Studio plugin as of now.

Projects in Repo:
Surface Filler - An app that applies a texture to surfaces that it detects. It also allows a user to place an object into augmented reality
